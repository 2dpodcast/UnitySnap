# UnitySnap ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

UnitySnap is a demo project with the goal of creating game mechanics & structures similar to those found in the classic game, Pokemon Snap. Ideally this will help game development students understand how games are made using common tools and interesting mechanics.

This is very much a work in progress and won't be done for a while. Feel free to watch for a bit - I'll be posting around everywhere once it's ready as a "shining example" for game development students.
